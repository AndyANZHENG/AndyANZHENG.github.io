But once you are passionate about something, does that mean you will be good at it? Or even able to make a living off it? Maybe. Maybe not.</p>\n<p>I grew up having interests in a lot of things, ping pong (not surprisingly as a Chinese), basketball, dancing, solving rubik’s cube, etc. But over the years I learned that it was almost impossible for me to keep being passionate about the same thing for a long time. I might intensively learn how to a rubik’s cube in 2 weeks and get to a point where I can show off to my classmate and be kind of proud of myself. Then I will stop. Maybe move onto something else. Maybe never pick up a rubik’s cube again. It is totally fine for small hobbies like that because we have many other things to try. But while I was thinking that, I was approaching graduation in high school and still did not what I should do for a living. Perfect way to put this will be that I kind of like doing A, but I cannot do A forever, nor do I think that I am talented. Then after a blink of an eye, I graduated university and started working. When in university, one thing I was certain about was that I sucked at education psychology and anything that requires me to memorize ton of text. Also, when it came to science subject, I was (or forced myself to be) kind of interested in every concept first but I did terrible in tests. There was no dedication or spirit in me that told me just do what it takes, like it or not.</p>\n<p>Essentially the world does not care if you are passionate about something. Put in the work. Get what you want. Maybe you will like the process. Maybe you will hate the process. If you don’t feel like doing the thing you are supposed to do, think like a machine. Don’t be scammed by the 0.001% actual passionate people’s talk about having to be 24/7 excited about the same thing to be successful.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Hardest Thing To Do (for me, as a human)","date":"July 28, 2020","description":"Maybe for you too, at some point in life"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hardest-thing-to-do/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/why-blogs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Blogs?"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1146911855","3000541721"]}
