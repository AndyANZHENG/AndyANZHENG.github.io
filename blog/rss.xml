&lt;p&gt;Having genuine interests or passion for something or many things is a great thing. But once you are passionate about something, does that mean you will be good at it? Or even able to make a living off it? Maybe. Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up having interests in a lot of things, ping pong (not surprisingly as a Chinese), basketball, dancing, solving rubik’s cube, etc. But over the years I learned that it was almost impossible for me to keep being passionate about the same thing for a long time. I might intensively learn how to a rubik’s cube in 2 weeks and get to a point where I can show off to my classmate and be kind of proud of myself. Then I will stop. Maybe move onto something else. Maybe never pick up a rubik’s cube again. It is totally fine for small hobbies like that because we have many other things to try. But while I was thinking that, I was approaching graduation in high school and still did not what I should do for a living. Perfect way to put this will be that I kind of like doing A, but I cannot do A forever, nor do I think that I am talented. Then after a blink of an eye, I graduated university and started working. When in university, one thing I was certain about was that I sucked at education psychology and anything that requires me to memorize ton of text. Also, when it came to science subject, I was (or forced myself to be) kind of interested in every concept first but I did terrible in tests. There was no dedication or spirit in me that told me just do what it takes, like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially the world does not care if you are passionate about something. Put in the work. Get what you want. Maybe you will like the process. Maybe you will hate the process. If you don’t feel like doing the thing you are supposed to do, think like a machine. Don’t be scammed by the 0.001% actual passionate people’s talk about having to be 24/7 excited about the same thing to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Blogs?]]></title><description><![CDATA[As I am typing the first sentence of my first blog ever, I still cannot believe it that I am doing something I absolutely hated when I was…]]></description><link>https://andyan.dev/why-blogs/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://andyan.dev/why-blogs/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As I am typing the first sentence of my first blog ever, I still cannot believe it that I am doing something I absolutely hated when I was young. Writing was never my thing and I sucked at it. Maybe there was too much pressure and the goal was too clear - getting a good score to make parents proud. That 600 or 800 words requirement was my worst nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time I considered writing blogs was 3 years ago. I even set up a WordPress website and bought a domain on Bluehost. It was stupid that I paid that much money for a CMS with many fancy features only few of which are actually useful for me. I did not know what I was doing and I did not even publish one blog with it as I lost interests. Nowadays I would much prefer a minimal site but with great extensibility and most importantly, as cheap as possible. I guess that is because skills and knowledge give me the freedom or ability to do it in the exact way I want and same with many other things. It also saves A LOT of money. (Running a site like this is almost for free. Just need to pay for a domain such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;andyan.dev&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I may reflect on things that I often think about but never had a chance to talk about, write about memorable time I spent with other people, or some technology I am interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I will add a comment section later. Maybe also a dark theme switcher. Maybe…&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
