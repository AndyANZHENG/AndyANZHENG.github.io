See picture below for inspiration:\n\n- Once the user hovers over the 4 icons, they should increase in size by 40%, once the users mouse leaves the icons their size should decrease to normal again\n\n<!-- slide vertical -->\n\n- Make the Learn More button clickable. Once the user clicks on it:\n  1. Remove the black overlay so that we can see the flowers clearly.\n  2. Change the title from ‘beautiful flowers’ to ‘welcome to my flower shop’, give the text a background and change the color to blue.\n  3. Change the text of the button from ‘learn more’ to ‘buy flowers’, change the background color to red.\n\n<!-- slide vertical -->\n\n## Bonus\n\nIf you can change the documents style with a button, try to change it back when the user clicks the button again.\n\nThis is what it should look like when the user clicks the button for the first time:\n\n<!-- slide vertical -->\n\n<img src=\"/ptcb/img/flowershop_js.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/Andy/Desktop/code/PROJECTS/xccelerate/ptcb-site/src/data/week_5_events/2019-10-31-slide.md","title":"2019 10 31 slide"}}}
