What is Bootstrap?\n\nBootstrap is free and it streamlines our development process by\n\n- Supporting mobile responsive design in its core.\n- Providing consistent style over different browsers and mobile devices.\n- Providing list of components and utilities to enrich our website.\n\nBy using it, we can reduce the number of custom CSS we have to write.\n\nBootstrap explained in [video](https://youtu.be/314m7YBRFvQ)\n\n### It Makes Responsive websites\n\nResponsive website design is the approach of making web content to relayout according to the size of screen (from Low resolution to HD monitor) without sacrificing all user experiences (UX).\n\nResponsive frameworks, like Bootstrap, use a variety of techniques, such as grid systems and flexible images (more on these below).\n\n### It Works Like A Grid\n\nThe grid system in Bootstrap separates web content and elements in up to 12 columns.\nDesigners and developers can lay out their content in any combination of these columns for various screen sizes.\n\nFor example, on a large screen, there are 3 columns of equal size placed alongside one another.  \nIf screen size decreases, Bootstrap’s predefined rules will make the columns start to appear one after the other.\nTherefore, the web content is displayed in a readable manner without worrying about customzing it ourselves.\n\n<img src=\"/ptcb/img/bootstrap_grid_transform.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n### It Has Responsive Images\n\nBootstrap also includes code that allows images to be automatically resized when screen size changes, by simply adding the `.img-responsive` class to your images. The predefined CSS rules take care of the rest. It can even change the shape of your images automatically by adding another class to them, like `.img-circle` and `.img-rounded`.\n\n### Compatibility\n\nBootstrap is compatible with all modern browsers as well as Internet Explorer. Plugins like HTML5Shiv and Respond.js come as part of Bootstrap’s default template. These help in porting HTML5 elements into older non-HTML5 browsers.\n\n### Documentation\n\nAnother advantage of Bootstrap is that it provides an impressive documentation, examples and demos.  \nIn this way, we can save our time to build the website as we do not need to explore everything before knowing how to use it.\nEverything is in the documentation!\n\n### Open source\n\nOne of the main reasons of using Bootstrap is the fact that it’s an open source project, hosted on Github.\nYou don’t have to deal with purchasing and licensing issues and it gives you the freedom to change it how you want it.\n\n### Code Examples\n\nLet’s have a glimpse of Bootstrap!\n\n<iframe\n     src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/bs4-code-sample-bv7g6?codemirror=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1\"\n     style=\"width:100%; height:700px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n     title=\"bs4-code-sample\"\n     allow=\"geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"\n   ></iframe>\n\nAs you can see from the above examples, bootstrap provides lots of production-ready css classes for developer to utilize.\nIt greatly reduces the effort to create and maintain these css rules.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are several ways to install Bootstrap and in this unit, we are going to introduce you to the `CDN` and `Direct Download` approach.\n\n### CDN\n\nThe easiest way to try Bootstrap is to include it from CDN - `Content Delivery Network`.\nCDN is a globally distributed network of proxy servers deployed in multiple data centers and it is dedicated to deliver static content to the users in a high performant way.\n\n### Direct Download\n\nLast but not least, you can always go to [Bootstrap website](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) and download the bootstrap library directly. This method is the most straightforward among all of the methods. One disadvantage of downloading directly is that you have to manage the version and dependency of this library manually afterwards.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Be Creative on Bootstrap](http://www.dagusa.com/)\n- [Learn Bootstrap in one vide](https://youtu.be/gqOEoUR5RHg)[o](https://youtu.be/gqOEoUR5RHg)\n\n## Exercise\n\nCreate a simple webpage\n\n1. Create a HTML page (`.html`)\n2. Install Bootstrap library through CDN.\n3.
