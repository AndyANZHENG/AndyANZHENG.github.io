Before we get started with our coding journey, we would like to provide you with some insight concerning our teaching philosophy as well as general aspects of the course. We also need to make sure that you have all the required software installed.\n\n## Topics taught in the course\n\nDuring the coming weeks, we will give be covering the following languages / frameworks / topics:\n\n- HTML\n- CSS\n- Bootstrap 4\n- JavaScript\n  - jQuery\n- Deployment of a website\n  - Surge\n- Git\n\n## Life as a developer\n\nEven a senior developer is likely to only master the art of a few languages, there are simply too many out there to understand them all. However, as a good developer you will be able to understand new technologies, languages or frameworks in a short time frame and will be able to teach them yourself. Our aim as a coding bootcamp is not to train you to become a perfect developer, but to teach you how to acquire the necessary knowledge as quickly as possible. It might very well be the case that later you won’t work with Node.js, React or PostgreSQL (skills we are teaching here in our full-time software engeering course) but Python or Angluar instead. However, having attended our bootcamp you should be able to quickly learn those different languages/frameworks.\n\n## Google\n\nThere is such a wealth of information out there especially related to coding, that you will find an answer to almost any question. You will most certainly find a lot of resources on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), where you’ll probably end up through Google. We also encourage you to read blog articles about coding since many good developers have a blog where they write about their daily problem solving tasks and the latest technology you need to catch up on. Having a blog helps developers get their name out and build up credibility, so these can be a good source of information.\n\nWhen you Google it is always better to be as specific as you can. `javascript error callback function` doesn’t really help you as much as `javascript setTimeout error \"callback\" argument must be a function`. It makes more sense to type out whole sentences or questions into Google, something that some people always seem a bit surprised of.\n\n## Other resources\n\nWhile we try to create a mix of text, code and videos for our curriculum, we are not the only resource available for coding knowledge. We will generally point out additional resources throughout the curriculum, but let’s name a few good sources besides StackOverflow and Google.\n\n- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)\n- [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/) has some great tutorials\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/Andy/Desktop/code/PROJECTS/xccelerate/ptcb-site/src/data/week_1_installation&basics/introduction.html.turndown.md","title":"introduction"}}}
