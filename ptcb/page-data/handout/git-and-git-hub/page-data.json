It helps you keep track of the changes that you and others do to your code. It is especially useful when several people collaborate on the same project. Git prevents people from accidentally overwriting each others code.\n\nGit is very useful when keeping track of your own code even if you working independently. Imagine you accidentally break your code by deleting some lines. Instead of trying to figure out what you deleted you can go back in history with git and see previous versions of the code. You must add and commit changes to store these file changes on Git.\n\n## GitHub\n\nIf you haven’t done so already, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create an account there. From now on you will use this account daily, other coders will see this account and it represents your work as a coding individual. So choose your username wisely.\n\nGitHub is a platform we can upload our code to via git and share it with others. Everybody can go through your public repositories and look at your code.\n\nIt is also a requirement for you to upload every exercise that you complete here at Xccelerate to GitHub, so that we can give you feedback.\n\nLater on when you work on group projects, you’ll be using GitHub to collaborate.\n\nWant more information on how you use GitHub to collaborate watch this [video](https://youtu.be/w3jLJU7DT5E)\n\nUsing Git\n\nWe assume that you have already installed Git on your machine. Check if it is working by typing this in the terminal:\n\n```bash\ngit --version\ngit version 2.x.x\n```\n\nSet up Git\n\n```bash\ngit config --global user.name \"First Last\"\ngit config --global user.email \"my@mail.com\"\n```\n\nIt is important that your email is the same as the one you used for GitHub\n\nNow we need to connect your GitHub with your git. For that we require your SSH key.\n\nSSH key is used to securely establish a connection through encryption. GitHub can verify that you are who you claim to be through looking at your SSH key. Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username or password at each visit.\n\nThis key consist out of two parts, the public and private key. You can share your public key, but the private key is only meant for you.\n\nLet’s check if you already have an SSH key generated, in your terminal type:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.ssh\nls\n```\n\nIf you can see in the listed document a file called `id_rsa.pub` you already have a SSH key generated and the please SKIP the next step. This is extremely important otherwise you overwrite your current SSH key. If you do not see the file it means you don’t have a key. This is how we can generate one.\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C my@mail.com\n```\n\nagain use your GitHub email.\n\nIf you are using Ubuntu , you can refer to this [link](https://garywoodfine.com/use-pbcopy-on-ubuntu/) to setup the pbcopy for your own machine. Now lets copy the public key that is generated:\n\n```bash\n# For Mac\npbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\n# For Windows\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip.exe\n\n# For ubuntu\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n# And then copy the output\n```\n\nCopy the key and Go to GitHub settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key and paste your public key that we just created.\n\nAfterwards create a new repository on GitHub call it `demo`\n\nGo back to your terminal, let’s change into the code folder we created recently in the terminal demo. In there we create a demo folder with a file called README.md inside, then initialize git.\n\n```bash\n# On Mac OSX/ Linux\ncd ~/code\n# On Windows Only\ncd /mnt/c/\n\n# And then..\nmkdir demo\ncd demo\necho \"# demo\" >> README.md\ngit init\n```\n\n`echo \"# demo\" >> README.md` is another way to create files, if you look at the README.md file in your editor you will notice it contains a `# demo` line.   \n`git init` initializes a new repository on your local machine.\n\nLet’s add our README.md file to git\n\n```bash\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -m 'first commit'\n```\n\n`git add [file]` specifies which files you want to add to the repository. If you have several files it is easiest to add files by just typing `git add .` which adds all files in the folder to git. ‘Add’ will only start the tracking process, but not properly engrave it to git, for that we need one more step.   \n`git commit -m '[message]'` will permanently make a record of the file version, which you later refer to by finding the commit id. The message should be short but descriptive, so that others can understand what happened. ‘added code’ is not very helpful, where as ‘fixed recursion error’ is a lot more helpful when you keep adding on top of your code.\n\nHowever, everything we have done so far is local, so let’s connect it to GitHub. For that we need the SSH link GitHub provided you when setting up your repository. You should replace `username` with your own username.\n\n```bash\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:username/demo.git\ngit push origin master\n```\n\n`git remote add` sets up the connection to GitHub, we usually call this connection `origin`   \n`git push [connection name] [branch]` pushes your version to GitHub. Master refers to the branch name, something we will talk about at a later stage.\n\nMake sure to insert your GitHub username in the `git remote` command.\n\n## Git Flow\n\nOnce your repository is set up those are the three commands you’ll need to use to upload a new version to GitHub. Remember them, you’ll need them all the time.\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m 'description'\ngit push origin master\n```\n\n## .gitignore\n\nThere are certain files which you don’t want to upload to GitHub. For example you might have a file in which you store passwords. This would be a bad idea if someone got a hold of them - especially if they are publicly available on GitHub. You can put the names of these files into a file called ‘.gitignore’. Create one in the root directory of you repository and add the relevant folders and files in there by name.\n\nIf you are using a Mac you might also want to include the ‘.DS_Store’ file. It’s a file Mac uses to record your folder preferences, there is nothing secretive in there but it is also pretty annoying to have on your GitHub.\n\n## Integration with Visual Studio Code\n\nYou can also use the third button on the left hand of the toolbar of Visual Studio Code which allows you to commit and push your files accordingly.\n\n# More Git\n\nWhile you may already know how to add and commit your code to GitHub, Git can do a lot more if you start using branches. Let us first refresh our Git knowledge with this video and then dig a little deeper.\n\n## Learning objectives\n\n- Use and merge branches\n- Understand pull requests and how to solve merge conflicts\n- Understand what a submodule is\n\nIf you need a refresher on Git, installation, Configuration and more [click](https://youtu.be/QqP7YZlZEOo) [here now](https://youtu.be/QqP7YZlZEOo)\n\n## Branches\n\nWhen you start working on a large project you don’t want to mess with the main code or source code, instead you want to make a copy of that code and start working on the copy instead. Once you are happy with your solution you can start to add your new code to the main code.\n\nIn order to achieve this separation of different codes we can use something called branches. Branches on GitHub are different copies of the same code with different changes applied to them. There will be times when you and several people are working on a project where everyone is going to be working on different branches. Once they have a feature or code that they are ready to commit, they will create a `pull request`. Other developers will check out the new code and if they agree with it, it will be merged into the main code.\n\nCreating a new branch\n\n```bash\ngit branch [branchname]\n```\n\nswapping into the new branch\n\n```bash\ngit checkout [branchname]\n```\n\n## Exercise\n\nIn the demo git repository from our introduction to Git, add a new branch called ‘dev’.\n\n1. Swap to this branch,\n2. Open the directory in the editor\n3. Add a file called ‘test.md’, write some text into that file.\n4. Close editor\n5. Git add and commit\n6. Now swap branch again to master.\n7. Open editor\n\nWhere is test.md?\n\nHere is a short [video](https://youtu.be/JTE2Fn_sCZs) regarding GitHub branches.\n\n## Merging\n\nImagine you have completed writing your new code and it is ready to be introduced into the main codebase. So you want to get code from your working branch to the master branch. To do that we use a process called merging branches.\n\n```bash\ngit checkout master\ngit merge [branch you were working on]\n```\n\nEt voila your new code has just been introduced into the master codebase.\n\nThis concept is done in our local machine. When working within a team of people or in a company you may need to set up pull requests mentioned above to verify code you are trying to add into your online source code.\n\n## Exercise\n\nTry merging the ‘dev’ branch from the previous exercise into ‘master', do this on ubuntu (windows) or the terminal (mac).\n\nAnother informative [video](https://youtu.be/0iuqXh0oojo) concerning Git merge and Workflow.\n\n## Pull\n\nImagine you work on a project with other team members and someone has just merged a branch into the master branch. That master branch is now updated on GitHub, but you don’t have the new code on your local machine. To get that code you need to pull it from GitHub.\n\n```bash\ngit pull origin [branch name]\n```\n\n### Pull requests\n\nIf you work in a team you don’t just simply merge your branch into master, you want your team members to review your code. They need to agree that all new code is functioning before they allow you to merge the branch. The usual flow is to open a pull request on GitHub, which will inform other team members of your merge intentions.\n\nWatch this [video](https://youtu.be/mcWsX_setW4) concerning Git Flow, and GitHub Pull Requests.\n\n## Merge conflicts\n\nSometimes when two developers have been working on the same section of a file, when they try to merge branches, Git doesn’t know which changes to merge. That results in a merge conflict, which is every developers nightmare. Git will mark the sections it cannot merge with a `<<<<<<<` and `========` as a divider between the two solutions. You have no choice but to manually go through your documents with a merge conflict and resolve the conflict by deleting one section and all of Git’s marks. Open the code in Visual Studios code to easily fix this merge issue. After you resolved the merge conflict `add` and `commit` again and you should be good to go.\n\n## Exercise\n\nYou don’t have to submit your answer for this exercise to us. Just practice it for yourself.\n\nGo back to the demo git repository, change to master branch.\n\n1. Create a new file called conflict.md\n2. Open with your Editor and put some text over several lines\n3. Git add and git commit\n4. Create a new branch called ‘feature’, checkout the branch\n5. Make some changes to the text in conflict.md, then git add and git commit\n6. Checkout master, make changes to the same text on similar lines you made changes to in ‘feature’ branch\n7. Git add, git commit,\n8. Merge feature into master\n\nTry to resolve the merge conflict that is in the file.\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/Andy/Desktop/code/PROJECTS/xccelerate/ptcb-site/src/data/week_2/git-and-git-hub.html.turndown.md","title":"git and git hub"}}}
