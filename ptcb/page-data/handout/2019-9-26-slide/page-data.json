Don't give up, it's hard for everyone.\n\n- Try to figure out things by yourself first before asking anyone (will tell you how later)\n\n<!-- slide -->\n\n## Problem Solving\n\n(in programming)\n\n- Google\n- Documentation\n- Stackoverflow\n- People\n\n<!-- slide -->\n\n## Documentation\n\n- There should be a documentation for almost every software / program / library\n- Best place to look for answers\n\n<!-- slide -->\n\n## Google\n\n- There is such a wealth of information out there especially related to coding, that you will find an answer to almost any question.\n\n- Worst thing can happen to a developer is probably when you have a problem that no one googled/had before\n\n<!-- slide vertical=true -->\n\n## Google (continue)\n\n- When you Google it is always better to be as specific as you can.\n\n  `javascript error callback function`\n\n  doesn’t really help you as much as\n\n  `javascript setTimeout error \"callback\" argument must be a function`\n\n<!-- slide -->\n\n## Other resources\n\n- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)\n- Scotch.io\n\n<!-- slide -->\n\n### Course Learning Outcomes\n\n- Can explain what programming is\n\n- Can tell what programming/markup languages including HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used for\n\n- Can explain and apply basic programming concepts including variables, primitive data types, objects, iterations, functions, classes, control flow and operators, etc.\n\n<!-- slide vertical=true -->\n\n## ..Continue\n\n- Can develop a personal website with Bootstrap 4\n\n- Can develop a interactive Canvas web app with JavaScript\n\n- Can use git to do version control\n\n<!-- slide -->\n\n## Coding for Absolute Beginners\n\nWeek 1, Lesson 1\n\n<!-- slide -->\n\n### What is coding/programming?\n\n`Input` ➡ `Some Program` ➡ `Output`\n⬆\n[the process of creating this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)\n\n<!-- slide -->\n\n### Computer Program\n\n- A computer program is essentially a collection of **instructions** that execute **a specific task** when run by a computer.\n- These programs can be written by anyone, though usually programmers are responsible for their creation.\n\n<!-- slide data-notes=\"Programming language: .for Java, its popularity stems from the fact that it is very readable, statically typed and relatively simple.
